# 2020 S2 ISYS2120 - DB Application Programming Assignment

Welcome to assignment 03 for ISYS2120.

This is the code base that you must modify for the purposes of the assignment.

Please look at the specification [file](isys2120_20s2_a03_specification.pdf) to see the full details regarding what you need to do for this assessment.

You will have to mainly have to modify 2 files: routes.py and database.py

You will also have to modify some templates in the 'templates/*.html' folder

## Task Outline

The media server is designed to keep track of files and metadata information regarding
various audio and video media.

### Schema Description

![ERD](ISYS2120_a3_erd.png)

As per the above schema you have various consumable media:

1. Movies
1. TV Shows (which have TV Episodes)
1. Songs (which are performed by Artists and appear in Albums)
1. Podcasts (which have Podcast Episodes)

There is also some User Account information which contains information about the user
including:

1. Contact Methods
1. Username / password
1. Subscribed podcasts
1. Consumed media

We have abstracted most of the common elements such descriptions, artwork and genres
into a MetaData table system. The primary Metadata table contains 3 fields:

1. an ID field (which other tables use a FK)
1. a MetaData type ID field (which maps to the MetaDataType table)
1. an actual value for the metadata

Presently, there are 4 possible types of metadata:

1. Song Genre
1. Film Genre
1. Artwork
1. Description

### Tasklist

You can find all the functions that you need to work on by looking for a 'TODO' comment in the code.

We have provided fully implemented functions and features that you can adapt to complete your tasks.

#### Data handling tasks

Your second task set is to complete the data handling for the last 4 SQL tasks from above.

You must complete the following functions in ’routes.py’:

1. single_podcast()
1. single_podcastep()
1. add_song()

You can write as many helper functions to assist you as you wish, just remember to
